## Introduction
*Duration: 1 minute*

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're diving deep into vibe coding. Over the next 20 minutes, we'll explore everything from the fundamentals to advanced professional techniques.

Let's begin with the foundation.

---

# VIBE CODING BASICS

## Section 1: Prompts
*Duration: 3 minutes*

There are three types of prompts you can use:

### Global Prompts:
Your coding tool automatically adds these Global prompts to every chat message and uses them when creating code or documents.

- Rules for your whole project that make sure every piece of code follows your team's standards
- Making sure your code follows system patterns - like MVC, microservices, or other design approaches
- Your team's habits for naming things, organizing files, and writing code in a consistent style
- Special domain knowledge for project like banking, healthcare, or online shopping

### Predefined Prompts:
You can also make one or more pre-defined prompts. They won't be added to every chat automatically, but they should be very easy and fast to use. Think of them as your own custom commands.

For example, you might have:
- Instruction files for different coding languages, documents, or types of projects
- Your own workflows: Create a personal process to handle common tasks automatically
- Checklists that make sure every piece of code you create meets your quality standards

### Ad-hoc Prompts:

Ad-hoc prompts are the most commonly used context when talking to your Coding Agent.
They can be different things like:
- What you type in the chat window when talking to your AI helper
- Code files from your project that the AI can read and understand
- Whole folders of code that the AI can look through and work with
- Web links to documentation or other helpful resources online

These ad-hoc prompts let your Agent understand what you're working on right now and give you the best solution for your specific situation.

## Section 2: Select LLMs
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### Most Common Models used for Vibe Coding

Let me walk you through the three most popular models that coding teams use:

**Claude Sonnet 3.7/4.0** is really good at complex architectural and coding tasks. It's great at understanding how different parts of your code work together and making smart decisions about code structure. When you're building complicated systems or fixing messy old code, Claude's strong understanding of code relationships makes it perfect for these tough jobs.

**Gemini 2.5 Pro** is good at coding and documentation work. It can look at pictures of designs and turn them into working code, or read through documentation and help you understand it. Its ability to work with different types of information like images and text, plus its fast responses, makes it great for quick prototyping and turning visual designs into code.

**GPT 4.1** works well across standard development workflows. It's your reliable helper for everyday coding work like fixing bugs, writing regular features, and handling routine development tasks. It gives you steady, dependable results for most common programming jobs.

There are not too many performance differences among these LLMs for daily common coding tasks. So why do we need multiple LLMs?

We need multiple LLMs to cross check plans and cross validate or review the generated code. When one AI creates a plan, you can ask another AI to review it and catch any problems. When one AI writes code, another AI can check it for bugs or better ways to do things. This gives you more confidence that your code is good and your plans will work.

## Section 3: Development Modes: Strategic vs Tactical Execution
*Duration: 7-9 minutes*

One of the most important concepts in vibe coding is understanding when to plan versus when to execute. Let me introduce you to our two primary development modes.

### Plan Mode 🧠 - Strategic Architecture Phase

Plan Mode is your strategic thinking phase. Use this when you're dealing with complex feature planning, system design, or technical debt assessment.

In Plan Mode, your AI focuses on:
- System architecture design and validation - mapping out how components will interact before writing a single line of code
- Component interaction mapping and dependency analysis - understanding the ripple effects of your architectural decisions
- Risk assessment and technical feasibility studies - identifying potential bottlenecks or challenges before they become problems
- Resource estimation and timeline planning - getting realistic projections for your development effort

The crucial point here is that Plan Mode involves no code execution. It's pure strategic thinking. You're designing the blueprint before construction begins.

### Action Mode ⚡ - Implementation and Execution

Action Mode is where the rubber meets the road. This is for feature implementation, bug fixes, testing, and deployment.

In Action Mode, your AI engages in:
- Real-time code generation and modification - writing and updating code as you work
- File system operations and project structure updates - creating directories, organizing files, managing project structure
- Command execution and environment management - running tests, starting servers, managing dependencies
- Testing and validation cycles - ensuring your code works as expected
- Direct system interaction and debugging - troubleshooting issues as they arise

### Mode Transition Strategy

The magic happens in knowing when to transition between modes:

**Plan → Action:** Always complete your design validation before jumping into implementation. I've seen too many projects fail because developers skipped the planning phase and dove straight into coding.

**Action → Plan:** Step back to planning mode when complexity exceeds your current scope. If you find yourself making architectural decisions on the fly during implementation, it's time to pause and plan.

Some teams use a hybrid approach with micro-planning within action cycles for complex features. The key is being intentional about which mode you're in and why.

## Section 4: Context Management: Maintaining AI Efficiency
*Duration: 5-7 minutes*

Context management is often overlooked, but it's critical for maintaining AI efficiency and getting consistent results.

### Context Lifecycle Management

Think of context as your AI's working memory. Just like human memory, it can become cluttered or lose focus over time.

#### Clear Contexts 🧹 - Fresh Start Strategy

Use clear contexts when you're starting new feature development or debugging complex issues. 

The benefits are significant: you eliminate bias from previous conversations that might be leading your AI down the wrong path. The process involves a complete state reset while preserving your project knowledge through memory banks, which we'll discuss later.

#### Compress Contexts 📦 - Intelligent Summarization

For long development sessions and iterative refinement, context compression is your friend.

This maintains continuity while optimizing performance. The process involves automated relevance scoring - your AI determines what information is still important and what can be summarized or discarded.

#### Smart Retention Algorithms

Modern AI systems use sophisticated algorithms for context management:
- Priority-based filtering of conversation history keeps the most relevant information accessible
- Automatic relevance scoring for code snippets and decisions ensures important context isn't lost
- Efficient token utilization helps with cost optimization - you're not paying for irrelevant context
- Context inheritance across related tasks maintains continuity when working on connected features

The key insight here is that context management isn't just about performance - it's about maintaining the quality and relevance of your AI's responses throughout long development sessions.

# VIBE CODING ADVANCED

## Section 5: Current AI Capabilities: Strengths and Strategic Applications
*Duration: 8-10 minutes*

Now let's move into advanced territory. Understanding where AI agents excel is crucial for leveraging them effectively in your development workflow.

### Where AI Agents Excel ✅

#### Rapid Prototyping and MVP Development

AI agents are exceptional at rapid prototyping. They can generate:
- Complete feature scaffolding with full CRUD operations in minutes, not hours
- API endpoint generation with proper error handling, validation, and documentation
- Database schema creation and migration scripts that follow best practices
- Integration testing suites for new components, ensuring your prototypes are production-ready

I've seen teams reduce their MVP development time by 60-70% using AI agents effectively for prototyping.

#### Algorithm Implementation and Optimization

When it comes to algorithmic work, AI agents shine:
- They can implement complex data structures with optimal time and space complexity
- Business logic implementation from detailed specifications becomes straightforward
- Performance optimization of existing algorithms often reveals improvements human developers might miss
- Mathematical computations and statistical analysis are handled with precision

#### Pattern-Based Code Generation

This is where AI agents really demonstrate their value:
- Template instantiation across similar components ensures consistency
- Style consistency maintenance throughout your codebase eliminates the "different developer, different style" problem
- Boilerplate reduction for repetitive implementations saves countless hours
- Code standardization according to team conventions happens automatically

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage

AI agents excel at testing:
- Unit test generation with edge case coverage that human developers often overlook
- Integration test scenarios for API endpoints that cover both happy paths and error conditions
- Mock data generation for realistic testing scenarios
- Test automation pipeline setup that integrates with your CI/CD workflow

The key insight is that AI agents are particularly strong at tasks that require pattern recognition, consistency, and comprehensive coverage.

## Section 6: Current Limitations: Where Agents Struggle ⚠️
*Duration: 6-8 minutes*

Understanding limitations is just as important as understanding strengths. Let me walk you through the four main areas where AI agents currently struggle.

### 1. Large Project Integration

AI agents often struggle with the big picture. They might:
- Add features without understanding the broader design implications
- Miss how their changes affect complex system architecture
- Fail to maintain consistency across different modules

For example, an AI might create a new authentication method without realizing it conflicts with the existing security architecture.

### 2. Code Duplication Issues

This is a common problem I see:
- AI agents generate redundant implementations because they don't always recognize existing functionality
- They miss existing utility functions that could be reused
- They create parallel solutions instead of extending existing ones

I've seen codebases where AI agents created three different date formatting functions because they weren't aware of the existing utility library.

### 3. Pattern Inconsistency

AI agents can break established patterns:
- They might not follow existing system patterns like MVC or established design patterns
- They ignore established conventions that aren't explicitly documented
- They break architectural principles that are implicit in the codebase

### 4. Library Utilization

Finally, AI agents often:
- Don't leverage available libraries effectively
- Choose alternative solutions unnecessarily, reinventing the wheel
- Miss optimization opportunities that existing libraries provide

The solution to these limitations isn't to avoid AI agents - it's to implement the enhanced development methodology we'll discuss next.

---

## Section 7: Enhanced Development Methodology
*Duration: 8-10 minutes*

To address the limitations we just discussed, we need a structured approach that combines human strategic thinking with AI implementation power.

### Developer-Led Process Framework

This is a five-step process that puts developers in the driver's seat for architectural decisions while leveraging AI for implementation.

#### 1. Design System Modules

The developer's first responsibility is to design clear system modules:
- Define clear module boundaries and responsibilities - what each module does and doesn't do
- Establish communication patterns between components - how modules interact
- Create modular architecture that supports independent development
- Document module dependencies and interaction contracts

This step is crucial because it gives the AI agent a clear framework to work within.

#### 2. Outline Module Interfaces

Next, specify the contracts:
- Define input/output contracts for each module - what goes in, what comes out
- Establish API signatures and data structures - the exact shape of your interfaces
- Create error handling protocols and exception management strategies
- Document interfaces specifically for AI agent reference

This documentation becomes the AI agent's guide for implementation.

#### 3. Design Unit Tests

Before any code is written, design your tests:
- Create test specifications that validate module behavior
- Define test cases that cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Establish acceptance criteria for each component
- Design boundary condition tests that push your modules to their limits

This test-first approach ensures the AI agent understands exactly what success looks like.

#### 4. Refactor for Consistency

After the AI generates code, the developer ensures:
- Pattern compliance across all generated code
- Architectural principles are maintained throughout the codebase
- Naming conventions and code organization follow team standards
- Performance optimization and elimination of code duplication

#### 5. Review Generated Code

Finally, validate everything:
- Check implementation against design specifications
- Assess code quality and maintainability standards
- Verify integration points and system compatibility
- Ensure security and performance requirements are met

### AI-Human Collaboration Model

The key insight is role clarity:
- **Developer designs:** Architecture, interfaces, tests, and standards
- **AI implements:** Code generation, pattern following, and documentation
- **Developer validates:** Quality, integration, performance, and security

This collaboration model addresses the limitations we discussed while maximizing the strengths of both human creativity and AI efficiency.

## Section 8: Memory Banks: Persistent Project Intelligence
*Duration: 6-8 minutes*

Memory banks are one of the most powerful features in advanced vibe coding. They provide persistent project intelligence that survives context clears and session changes.

### Structured Knowledge Management System

Think of memory banks as your project's institutional memory, organized into three key components:

#### Project Brief 📋 - Strategic Foundation

The project brief contains:
- Core requirements and acceptance criteria - what you're building and how you'll know it's successful
- Primary use cases and user journey mapping - who uses your system and how
- Success metrics and performance benchmarks - measurable goals for your project
- Stakeholder alignment and business objectives - ensuring everyone understands the why behind the what

This becomes your AI agent's north star, ensuring every decision aligns with project goals.

#### System Patterns 🏗️ - Architectural Blueprint

System patterns document:
- Component architecture with Mermaid flowcharts - visual representations of your system structure
- Data flow diagrams and system interactions - how information moves through your system
- File structure and module organization - the physical layout of your codebase
- Design pattern implementation guidelines - consistent approaches to common problems

These patterns ensure architectural consistency across all AI-generated code.

#### Technical Context 🔧 - Implementation Details

Technical context includes:
- Dependency management with specific version requirements - exactly which libraries and versions you're using
- Library integration patterns and best practices - how to properly use your chosen tools
- External service configurations and API specifications - integration details for third-party services
- Environment setup and deployment procedures - how to run and deploy your application

### Memory Bank Benefits

The benefits are substantial:
- **Consistent context** across development sessions - your AI agent remembers project details even after context clears
- **Reduced onboarding** time for new team members - memory banks serve as comprehensive project documentation
- **Architectural compliance** enforcement - the AI agent automatically follows established patterns
- **Knowledge preservation** and institutional memory - critical project knowledge doesn't walk out the door with departing team members

Memory banks transform AI agents from session-based tools into persistent project partners.

## Section 9: Advanced Task Management and Execution Strategy
*Duration: 7-9 minutes*

Advanced task management is where vibe coding really shows its enterprise-level capabilities.

### Intelligent Task Orchestration

#### Task Creation and Decomposition

The process starts with intelligent analysis:
- Requirements analysis from PRDs and user stories - breaking down business requirements into technical tasks
- Complexity assessment and effort estimation - understanding the scope and difficulty of each task
- Dependency mapping and critical path identification - understanding what needs to happen when
- Resource allocation and timeline planning - realistic project scheduling

This isn't just project management - it's intelligent project management that understands technical complexity.

#### Execution Methodology

The execution approach focuses on:
- Incremental delivery with continuous validation - delivering working software frequently
- Quality gates at each development milestone - ensuring quality doesn't slip as you move fast
- Pattern consistency enforcement throughout implementation - maintaining architectural integrity
- Context-aware decision making based on project history - learning from past decisions and outcomes

#### Progress Tracking and Optimization

Advanced systems provide:
- Real-time progress monitoring with automated reporting - always knowing where you stand
- Dependency resolution and bottleneck identification - proactively addressing blockers
- Quality metrics tracking and trend analysis - understanding your team's performance patterns
- Rollback strategies for failed implementations - quick recovery when things go wrong

### Task Management Best Practices

The key practices that make this work:
- **Single active task** focus to prevent context switching - multitasking kills productivity
- **Clear completion criteria** for each task - everyone knows what "done" looks like
- **Regular checkpoint** reviews and course correction - staying aligned with project goals
- **Documentation updates** with each completed task - maintaining project knowledge

This systematic approach transforms chaotic development into predictable, high-quality delivery.

# VIBE CODING PROFESSIONAL

## Section 10: Tips
*Duration: 5-7 minutes*

Let me share some hard-earned wisdom from teams using vibe coding in production environments.

### Essential Development Guidelines

#### 1. The 3-Strike Rule

When an approach isn't working, don't keep banging your head against the wall. After three failed attempts with the same strategy, change your approach. This might mean:
- Switching AI models
- Changing your prompt strategy
- Breaking the problem down differently
- Taking a step back to plan mode

#### 2. Context Management Every 10 Messages

This is a practical rule that prevents context degradation. After every 10 messages in a conversation with your AI agent, either compress or clear the context. This maintains optimal AI performance and prevents the conversation from drifting off-topic.

#### 3. Describe Requirements Clearly

Vague descriptions lead to vague results. Instead of saying "the UI doesn't work properly," be specific: "the page crashes on refresh when the user is not authenticated." The more specific you are, the better your AI agent can help you.

#### 4. Version Control is Your Escape Hatch

Commit your code after each successful iteration with your AI agent. This gives you confidence to experiment boldly because you can always roll back. I've seen teams become much more innovative when they know they have a safety net.

#### 5. Last Resort: Burn It Down

Sometimes, complexity becomes unmanageable. When refactoring isn't enough and the codebase has become too tangled, don't be afraid to start fresh. Sometimes a clean slate is more efficient than trying to untangle a mess.

These aren't just tips - they're battle-tested strategies from teams shipping production code with AI agents.

## Section 11: MCP Servers
*Duration: 6-8 minutes*

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers represent the cutting edge of AI development integration. These are specialized servers that extend your AI agent's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services.

### Advanced Integration Capabilities

#### 1. Figma Integration

This is a game-changer for frontend development. With Figma MCP servers:
- Your AI agent can pull UI designs directly from Figma
- It can analyze design specifications and generate corresponding React, Vue, or Angular components
- Design tokens and style guides are automatically translated into CSS or styled-components
- Changes in Figma can trigger automatic code updates

Imagine designing a new dashboard in Figma and having your AI agent generate the complete React implementation, including responsive breakpoints and accessibility features.

#### 2. JIRA Integration

Project management becomes seamless:
- Pull ticket details directly into your development environment
- Generate comprehensive task and to-do lists from JIRA tickets
- Automatically update ticket status as development progresses
- Link code commits to specific tickets for full traceability

This creates a seamless flow from project planning to code delivery.

#### 3. Context7

This solves the documentation problem:
- Always pulls the latest library and SDK documentation from the internet
- Ensures your AI agent is working with current API specifications
- Automatically updates when libraries release new versions
- Provides real-time access to community best practices and examples

No more outdated documentation leading to deprecated code patterns.

#### 4. StageWise

This is particularly powerful for full-stack development:
- A browser toolbar that connects your frontend UI directly to your code AI agents
- Click on any UI element and get the corresponding code
- Make changes in your editor and see them reflected immediately in the browser
- Debug UI issues by connecting visual problems to code solutions

These integrations transform AI agents from isolated tools into integrated parts of your entire development ecosystem.

## Section 12: Best Coding Agent in the Market
*Duration: 4-6 minutes*

Let me give you an honest comparison of the leading coding agents currently available.

### Leading Platform Comparison

#### 1. Claude Code

Claude Code stands out for several reasons:

**Built-in Task Breakdown Feature:** This is huge for complex projects. Claude Code automatically breaks down your input into a structured to-do list, making implementation more accurate and systematic. Instead of trying to tackle a large feature all at once, it creates a step-by-step plan.

**Context Management Commands:** 
- Use `/clear` to completely clear the context and start fresh
- Use `/compact` to compress the context while maintaining important information

This gives you fine-grained control over context management, which is crucial for long development sessions.

#### 2. Roo Code

Roo Code's standout feature is its **excellent context auto-compress capability**. This makes the agent both fast and cost-efficient by automatically managing context without manual intervention. It's particularly valuable for teams working on large codebases where context can quickly become unwieldy.

### Platform Selection Considerations

When choosing a platform, consider:
- **Project complexity** - More complex projects benefit from Claude Code's task breakdown
- **Team size** - Larger teams might prefer Roo Code's automatic context management
- **Budget constraints** - Context compression directly impacts costs
- **Integration requirements** - Which platform works best with your existing tools

The key is matching the platform capabilities to your specific needs and workflow requirements.
