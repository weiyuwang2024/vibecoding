## Introduction
*Duration: 1 minute*

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're diving deep into vibe coding. Over the next 20 minutes, we'll explore everything from the fundamentals to advanced professional techniques.

Let's begin with the foundation.

---

# VIBE CODING BASICS

## Section 1: Prompts
*Duration: 3 minutes*

There are three types of prompts you can use:

### Global Prompts:
Your coding tool automatically adds these Global prompts to every chat message and uses them when creating code or documents.

- Rules for your whole project that make sure every piece of code follows your team's standards
- Making sure your code follows system patterns - like MVC, microservices, or other design approaches
- Your team's habits for naming things, organizing files, and writing code in a consistent style
- Special domain knowledge for project like banking, healthcare, or online shopping

### Predefined Prompts:
You can also make one or more pre-defined prompts. They won't be added to every chat automatically, but they should be very easy and fast to use. Think of them as your own custom commands.

For example, you might have:
- Instruction files for different coding languages, documents, or types of projects
- Your own workflows: Create a personal process to handle common tasks automatically
- Checklists that make sure every piece of code you create meets your quality standards

### Ad-hoc Prompts:

Ad-hoc prompts are the most commonly used context when talking to your Coding Agent.
They can be different things like:
- What you type in the chat window when talking to your AI helper
- Code files from your project that the AI can read and understand
- Whole folders of code that the AI can look through and work with
- Web links to documentation or other helpful resources online

These ad-hoc prompts let your Agent understand what you're working on right now and give you the best solution for your specific situation.

All the popular Coding Agents you can use today support these three kinds of prompts

## Section 2: Support Multiple LLMs
*Duration: 2 minutes*

### Most Common Models used for Vibe Coding

Let me walk you through the three most popular models that coding teams use:

**Claude Sonnet 3.7/4.0** is really good at complex architectural and coding tasks. It's great at understanding how different parts of your code work together and making smart decisions about code structure. When you're building complicated systems or fixing messy old code, Claude's strong understanding of code relationships makes it perfect for these tough jobs.

**Gemini 2.5 Pro** is good at coding and documentation work. It can look at pictures of designs and turn them into working code, or read through documentation and help you understand it. Its ability to work with different types of information like images and text, plus its fast responses, makes it great for quick prototyping and turning visual designs into code.

**GPT 4.1** works well across standard development workflows. It's your reliable helper for everyday coding work like fixing bugs, writing regular features, and handling routine development tasks. It gives you steady, dependable results for most common programming jobs.

There are not too many performance differences among these LLMs for daily common coding tasks. So why do we need multiple LLMs?

We need multiple LLMs to cross check plans and cross validate or review the generated code. When one AI creates a plan, you can ask another AI to review it and catch any problems. When one AI writes code, another AI can check it for bugs or better ways to do things. This gives you more confidence that your code is good and your plans will work.

You might want to have a coding agent that has a feature to quickly switch between different LLMs, or have multiple coding agents running in your code editor at the same time. This way you can easily get different opinions and check your work without switching between different tools.

---

## Section 3: Agent Mode
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

### Plan Mode 🧠 - Thinking and Planning Phase

Plan Mode is when you want your AI to think and plan things out. Use this when you're working on complicated features, designing systems, or figuring out how to fix old messy code.

In Plan Mode, your Agent works on:
- Designing how your system will work - figuring out how different parts will talk to each other before you write any code
- Understanding how parts connect and depend on each other - knowing what happens when you change one thing
- Checking for problems and seeing if your ideas will actually work - finding issues before they become big problems
- Estimating how much work things will take and planning timelines - getting realistic ideas about how long things will take

The important thing about Plan Mode is that it's only for thinking and planning - It don't write any actual code during this phase. You can talk to AI Agent back and forth to make sure Agent understand all the details and create a complete project plan before it start building anything.

### Action Mode ⚡ - Building and Making Things

Action Mode is where you actually get things done. This is for building features, fixing bugs, testing your code, and putting it live.

In Action Mode, your Agent does:
- Writing and changing code - creating and updating code as you work together
- Managing files and organizing your project - making folders, organizing files, keeping your project neat
- Running commands and managing your development setup - running tests, starting servers, handling the tools you need
- Testing and checking that things work - making sure your code does what it's supposed to do

### When to Switch Between Modes

The smart part is knowing when to switch between these modes:

**Plan → Action:** Always finish your planning and design checking before you start building. I've seen many projects fail because developers skipped the planning part and jumped straight into writing code.

**Action → Plan:** Go back to planning mode when things get too complicated for what you're currently doing. If you find yourself making big design decisions while you're trying to build, it's time to stop and plan.


A good Coding Agent needs to support both Plan Mode and Action Mode.

## Section 4: Context Management:
*Duration: 2 minutes*

Context management is really important for keeping your AI working well and getting good results every time.

### Clear Context

Use clear context when you're starting to work on new features. This is also helpful when you've been working on one problem for a long time and want to switch to something completely different, or when the AI seems stuck on the wrong approach.

### Compress Context

Keep in mind that longer context is not always better.

For long coding sessions and when you're working on the same thing over and over, context compression is really helpful.

Compress context will make the key points clearer and also lower the cost and make things faster. When you have too much context, your AI can get confused by all the extra information and might focus on the wrong things. By compressing context, your AI can focus on what really matters for your current work.

Most of the current coding agents support manually clearing and compressing context. However, Roo Code performs extremely well by automatically compressing the context without you having to ask. This automatic feature makes it more cost efficient and faster than other coding agents because it's always managing your context in the background, so you don't have to think about it or remember to do it yourself.

# VIBE CODING ADVANCED

## Section 5: Current AI Capabilities: Strengths and Strategic Applications
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

### Where Coding Agents Work Really Well ✅

#### 1. Building Prototypes

Coding agents are very good at building prototypes, but only if you don't care about system design and project maintenance. They can quickly create working demos and proof-of-concepts that show your ideas in action. This is perfect when you need to test an idea fast or show something to stakeholders. However, the code they generate for prototypes usually isn't organized well for long-term projects. It works for showing concepts, but you'll need to redesign it properly if you want to build a real product from it.

#### 2. Implementing Well-Known Algorithms

Coding agents are very good at implementing well-known algorithms like search algorithms, travel algorithms, sorting methods, and other standard computer science solutions. Since these algorithms are well-documented and have been written many times before, AI agents can create clean, working versions of them quickly. They understand the patterns and can implement things like binary search, graph traversal, or pathfinding algorithms without much trouble.

#### 3. Creating Similar Code with Templates

Coding agents are very good at implementing similar code and features when you give them sample code as a template. If you show them how you built one feature, they can create similar features following the same pattern. This is great for building multiple API endpoints that work the same way, creating similar UI components, or adding features that follow your existing code style. The key is giving them a good example to follow.

#### 4. Writing Unit Tests

Coding agents are good at writing unit tests. They can look at your functions and create tests that check if the code works correctly. They're especially good at thinking of different test cases and edge cases that you might forget. They can create tests that check normal situations, error situations, and unusual inputs. This saves developers time and often catches problems that human testers might miss.

The important thing to remember is that coding agents work best when the task is well-defined and follows known patterns.

---

## Section 6: Current Limitations: Where Agents Struggle ⚠️
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

### 1. Adding New Features Without the Big Picture

Coding agents often add new features without understanding the design. They don't see how the whole system works together, so they might build something that doesn't fit well with what already exists. For example, they might create a new way to handle user login without knowing that there's already a security system in place that handles authentication differently. This creates conflicts and problems that are hard to fix later.

### 2. Failed to Maintain Consistency Across Different Modules

Coding agents fail to maintain consistency across different modules in your project. Each part of your code might be written in a different style or follow different patterns, even though they should all work together smoothly. One module might handle errors one way, while another module handles the same type of errors completely differently. This makes the codebase confusing and harder to maintain over time.

### 3. Generate Duplicate Code

Coding agents may generate duplicate code because they don't always recognize existing functionality that's already been built. They might create a new function to format dates when there's already a date formatting function somewhere else in the codebase. This happens because they can't see or understand all the existing code, especially in large projects. You end up with multiple pieces of code that do the same thing, which makes your project bigger and harder to maintain.

### 4. Introduce unexpected Libraries

Coding agents may choose unexpected libraries instead of using the tools and libraries that are already part of your project. They might suggest adding new libraries that do the similar job as what you already have, or pick libraries that don't fit well with your existing setup. This can cause conflicts and make your project harder to manage. 

---

## Section 7: New Development Flow
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

To fix the problems we just talked about, we need to reorganize the development flow.

#### 1. Drive System Design and Build Project Design Document

The developer's first job is to drive the system design and build a simple project design document that includes modules and shows the module interfaces. This means you create a clear plan that shows how your whole system will work, what different parts you need, and how these parts will talk to each other. You write down the main modules, what each module does, and how they connect together. This document becomes the base that guides all the work that comes after it. Think of it like making a blueprint before you build a house - it shows everyone what you're trying to build and how all the pieces fit together.

#### 2. Generate Tasks Based on Feature Requirements

Next, you generate tasks based on feature requirements and project documents. If the task is too big, break it down into smaller tasks that are easier to handle. Look at what features you need to build and use your project documents to figure out what work needs to be done. When you have a big feature, don't try to build it all at once. Instead, break it into smaller pieces that are easier to work with. This makes it much easier for the AI helper to understand what you want and build each piece the right way. It's like eating a big meal - you don't try to eat everything at once, you take smaller bites.

#### 3. Design and Create Unit Tests for Module Interfaces

Design and create unit tests for the module interfaces. Write tests that check if each module works the way it's supposed to work. These tests should cover normal situations when everything works fine, error situations when things go wrong, and edge cases that are unusual but might happen. This is to make sure the new feature works and fits properly with existing code. These tests are also really helpful when we need to change the codebase later because they tell us if we broke anything.

#### 4. Review and Refactor Generated Code

After the AI Agent builds the feature, you need to review the generated code and refactor the code to make sure the new code follows the same patterns, and remove any duplicate code. Look carefully at what the AI built and check if it matches your design plan. Make sure the new code uses the same style and patterns as the rest of your project. If you find duplicate code or code that doesn't fit your patterns, fix it so everything works together smoothly. This step is really important because it keeps your whole project organized and easy to understand.

#### 5. Update Project Documents

Finally, update the project documents with new feature changes. Keep your design documents current so they show exactly what you've built. This helps future development work and makes sure your documentation stays useful for Agent to build the next feature.

## Section 8: Memory Banks: Persistent Project Memory
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

### Organized Knowledge Management System

Memory banks are the long-term memory of your project, made up of three important parts:

#### Project Brief 📋 - Basic Foundation

The project brief has:
- Project requirements and success rules - what you're building and how you'll know it worked
- Main use cases - who uses your system and how they use it
- Success numbers and performance goals - ways to measure if your project is doing well
- Team agreement and business goals - making sure everyone understands why you're building this

#### System Patterns 🏗️ - Building Blueprint

System patterns write down:
- System architecture - pictures that show how your system is built
- Module explanation with what are the input and output
- Data flow pictures and system connections - how information moves through your system
- File and folder structures - how your code files are arranged and organized

#### Technical Context 🔧 - Building Details

Technical context includes:
- Libraries used with versions - what code libraries and tools your project needs to work properly
- External dependencies - outside services and APIs that your project connects to and relies on
- Environment setup - how to set up your development environment and deploy your application to make it work

### Memory Bank Good Things

The good things are really big:
- **Same context** across development sessions - your AI helper remembers project details even after context clears
- **Less time to learn** for new team members - memory banks work like complete project documentation
- **Following rules** enforcement - the AI helper automatically follows established patterns
- **Knowledge keeping** and team memory - important project knowledge doesn't leave when team members go away

Memory banks change AI helpers from session-based tools into long-lasting project partners that remember everything about your work.

## Section 9: Advanced Task Management and Execution Strategy
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

Advanced task management is where vibe coding really shows its enterprise-level capabilities.

### Intelligent Task Orchestration

#### Task Creation and Decomposition

The process starts with intelligent analysis:
- Requirements analysis from PRDs and user stories - breaking down business requirements into technical tasks
- Complexity assessment and effort estimation - understanding the scope and difficulty of each task
- Dependency mapping and critical path identification - understanding what needs to happen when
- Resource allocation and timeline planning - realistic project scheduling

This isn't just project management - it's intelligent project management that understands technical complexity.

#### Execution Methodology

The execution approach focuses on:
- Incremental delivery with continuous validation - delivering working software frequently
- Quality gates at each development milestone - ensuring quality doesn't slip as you move fast
- Pattern consistency enforcement throughout implementation - maintaining architectural integrity
- Context-aware decision making based on project history - learning from past decisions and outcomes

#### Progress Tracking and Optimization

Advanced systems provide:
- Real-time progress monitoring with automated reporting - always knowing where you stand
- Dependency resolution and bottleneck identification - proactively addressing blockers
- Quality metrics tracking and trend analysis - understanding your team's performance patterns
- Rollback strategies for failed implementations - quick recovery when things go wrong

### Task Management Best Practices

The key practices that make this work:
- **Single active task** focus to prevent context switching - multitasking kills productivity
- **Clear completion criteria** for each task - everyone knows what "done" looks like
- **Regular checkpoint** reviews and course correction - staying aligned with project goals
- **Documentation updates** with each completed task - maintaining project knowledge

This systematic approach transforms chaotic development into predictable, high-quality delivery.

# VIBE CODING TIPS

## Section 10: Tips
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

Let me share some hard-earned wisdom from teams using vibe coding in production environments.

### Essential Development Guidelines

#### 1. The 3-Strike Rule

When an approach isn't working, don't keep banging your head against the wall. After three failed attempts with the same strategy, change your approach. This might mean:
- Switching AI models
- Changing your prompt strategy
- Breaking the problem down differently
- Taking a step back to plan mode

#### 2. Context Management Every 10 Messages

This is a practical rule that prevents context degradation. After every 10 messages in a conversation with your AI agent, either compress or clear the context. This maintains optimal AI performance and prevents the conversation from drifting off-topic.

#### 3. Describe Requirements Clearly

Vague descriptions lead to vague results. Instead of saying "the UI doesn't work properly," be specific: "the page crashes on refresh when the user is not authenticated." The more specific you are, the better your AI agent can help you.

#### 4. Version Control is Your Escape Hatch

Commit your code after each successful iteration with your AI agent. This gives you confidence to experiment boldly because you can always roll back. I've seen teams become much more innovative when they know they have a safety net.

#### 5. Last Resort: Burn It Down

Sometimes, complexity becomes unmanageable. When refactoring isn't enough and the codebase has become too tangled, don't be afraid to start fresh. Sometimes a clean slate is more efficient than trying to untangle a mess.

These aren't just tips - they're battle-tested strategies from teams shipping production code with AI agents.

## Section 11: MCP Servers
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers represent the cutting edge of AI development integration. These are specialized servers that extend your AI agent's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services.

### Advanced Integration Capabilities

#### 1. Figma Integration

This is a game-changer for frontend development. With Figma MCP servers:
- Your AI agent can pull UI designs directly from Figma
- It can analyze design specifications and generate corresponding React, Vue, or Angular components
- Design tokens and style guides are automatically translated into CSS or styled-components
- Changes in Figma can trigger automatic code updates

Imagine designing a new dashboard in Figma and having your AI agent generate the complete React implementation, including responsive breakpoints and accessibility features.

#### 2. JIRA Integration

Project management becomes seamless:
- Pull ticket details directly into your development environment
- Generate comprehensive task and to-do lists from JIRA tickets
- Automatically update ticket status as development progresses
- Link code commits to specific tickets for full traceability

This creates a seamless flow from project planning to code delivery.

#### 3. Context7

This solves the documentation problem:
- Always pulls the latest library and SDK documentation from the internet
- Ensures your AI agent is working with current API specifications
- Automatically updates when libraries release new versions
- Provides real-time access to community best practices and examples

No more outdated documentation leading to deprecated code patterns.

#### 4. StageWise

This is particularly powerful for full-stack development:
- A browser toolbar that connects your frontend UI directly to your code AI agents
- Click on any UI element and get the corresponding code
- Make changes in your editor and see them reflected immediately in the browser
- Debug UI issues by connecting visual problems to code solutions

These integrations transform AI agents from isolated tools into integrated parts of your entire development ecosystem.

## Section 12: Best Coding Agent in the Market
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

Let me give you an honest comparison of the leading coding agents currently available.

### Leading Platform Comparison

#### 1. Claude Code

Claude Code stands out for several reasons:

**Built-in Task Breakdown Feature:** This is huge for complex projects. Claude Code automatically breaks down your input into a structured to-do list, making implementation more accurate and systematic. Instead of trying to tackle a large feature all at once, it creates a step-by-step plan.

**Context Management Commands:** 
- Use `/clear` to completely clear the context and start fresh
- Use `/compact` to compress the context while maintaining important information

This gives you fine-grained control over context management, which is crucial for long development sessions.

#### 2. Roo Code

Roo Code's standout feature is its **excellent context auto-compress capability**. This makes the agent both fast and cost-efficient by automatically managing context without manual intervention. It's particularly valuable for teams working on large codebases where context can quickly become unwieldy.

### Platform Selection Considerations

When choosing a platform, consider:
- **Project complexity** - More complex projects benefit from Claude Code's task breakdown
- **Team size** - Larger teams might prefer Roo Code's automatic context management
- **Budget constraints** - Context compression directly impacts costs
- **Integration requirements** - Which platform works best with your existing tools

The key is matching the platform capabilities to your specific needs and workflow requirements.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
*Duration: 1-2 minutes*

As we wrap up today's comprehensive guide to AI-powered development, let me leave you with the key takeaways and a practical roadmap for implementation.

### Key Takeaways

**Strategic AI utilization** requires understanding both capabilities and limitations. Don't try to use AI for everything - use it where it excels and maintain human oversight where it struggles.

**Human-AI collaboration** is most effective with clear role definitions. Developers design, AI implements, developers validate. This division of labor maximizes the strengths of both.

**Systematic approach** to context and task management improves outcomes dramatically. The teams that succeed with AI-powered development are those that treat it as an engineering discipline, not just a productivity hack.

**Continuous learning** and adaptation are essential for success. The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and your practices need to evolve with it.

### Implementation Roadmap

Here's your practical next steps:

1. **Establish memory banks** for your current projects - Start documenting your project briefs, system patterns, and technical context
2. **Define development workflows** with clear AI integration points - Decide where and how AI fits into your current processes
3. **Train team members** on best practices and tool utilization - Everyone needs to understand the methodology, not just the tools
4. **Implement quality gates** and review processes - Ensure AI-generated code meets your standards
5. **Monitor and optimize** AI-human collaboration effectiveness - Measure results and continuously improve your approach

The future of software development isn't about replacing developers with AI - it's about augmenting human creativity and problem-solving with AI efficiency and consistency.

Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to take questions about any aspect of AI-powered development we've covered today.
