### Essential Development Guidelines

1. **3-strike rule** - Change strategy after three failed attempts
2. **Context compress or clear for every 10 messages** - Maintain optimal AI performance
3. **Describe your requirements clearly** - Don't use words like "the UI doesn't work properly", instead use something like: "the page crashes on refresh"
4. **Version control is your escape hatch** - Commit after each successful iteration with agent
5. **Last resort: Burn it down** - Start fresh when complexity becomes unmanageable
